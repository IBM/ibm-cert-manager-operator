### Developer guide

Information about building and testing the operator.
- Developer quick start
  1. Follow the [ODLM guide](https://github.com/IBM/operand-deployment-lifecycle-manager/blob/master/docs/install/common-service-integration.md#end-to-end-test).

- Debugging the operator
  1. Check the certificate manager CR.

    ````
    kubectl get certmanager
    kubectl describe certmanager <certmanager CR name>
    ````

  1. Look at the logs of the cert-manager-operator pod for errors

    ````
    kubectl get po -n <namespace>
    kubectl logs -n <namespace> <cert-manager-operator pod name>
    ````

**NOTE:** The certificate manager service (operand) is a singleton. Do not run more than one instance of `cert-manager-controller` within the same cluster.

## SecurityContextConstraints Requirements

The cert-manager service supports running under the OpenShift Container Platform default restricted security context constraints.
